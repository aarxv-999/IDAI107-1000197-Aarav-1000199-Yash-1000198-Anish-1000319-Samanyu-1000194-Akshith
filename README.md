## Features
- **AI Recipe and Menu Generation**
  1. Reduces chef planning time and enables dynamic menu updates.
  2. Uses the ingredients data from the ingredient_inventory (updatable) database from Firebase to generate the menu based on the ingredients' expiry date and other data.
  3. The weekly menu (recipe list) is generated by Gemini using the data from Firebase and can be stored in Firebase, where the customers can access it for the menu.
  4. Gamification Factor: The chefs can upload a recipe to the menu that is rated by Gemini, which adds XP to the chef's user profile.

- **AI Promotions Generation**
  1. Generates personalized marketing content (e.g., offers, discounts).
  2. A staff member can generate a creative marketing strategy by filling out certain fields. Gemini takes the information to generate a personalized marketing campaign.
  3. Each of these campaigns is, in turn, rated by Gemini itself and stored in the database.
  4. Gamification Factor: These campaigns are displayed on the main page of the customer as a notification that can be liked or disliked; each like gives certain XP to the staff.

- **Visual Search and Personalized Menu**
  1. Customers can find suitable food according to their preferences using visual search.
  2. The customers' preferences are stored in Firebase. When a customer uses visual search, the user preferences and the data about the dish in the image are taken into consideration for recommending similar or the same dish.
  3. Gamification Factor: Similar dishes get XP for the chef who first made them.

- **Leftover Management**
  1. The chefs can input leftover ingredients after each day.
  2. The system suggests optimized ways to reuse them in future dishes.
  3. Helps reduce wastage and tracks the impact made.
  4. Gamification Factor: Reducing waste over time gives chefs special badges and XP.

- **Event Manager**
  1. Staff can use an AI-powered chatbot to plan special events with themes.
  2. Suggests menus, layouts, and guest limits based on inventory and preferences.
  3. Chatbot responses are saved to Firebase.

- **Ingredients Manager Dashboard**
  1. Tracks ingredients, highlights low/expired stock.
  2. Shows recommended re-orders.
  3. Connects with Menu Generator and Leftover Manager.
